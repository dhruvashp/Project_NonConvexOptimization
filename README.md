# Project_NonConvexOptimization

The current files represent the work done for the Final Project in course EE546, at USC, in Fall 2020, under Prof. Mahdi Soltanolkotabi.

The project report has been uploaded, describing an outline of the papers surveyed.

The codes have not been submitted yet, since, a research paper is being written currently on the basis of the project report.

The main work being done is:

Non-Convex Optimization for LASSO (the non-convex lasso), and comparing the results with the current techniques used to optimize the non-convex lasso

Once work is done on the paper and a conclusion to the work occurs in finality, the codes and the relevant paper will be uploaded
